# FUTURE KIRBV DONT FORGET ABOUT THIS!!!

## THE SYSTEM (ideas)
- index lets you select oc universe (leads to html file about said universe)
- the universe files are the ones that actually have the characters
- "refs" is the folder with the characters
- every character is its own folder inside the refs folder
- all characters follow a template, index.html is the character page and [think of how the rest of the files are gonna be named later]
- "assets" folder for images that aren't used by any particular character
## TO DO LIST
- rework the website to fit the system described above
- complete template, template images use the artfight ref artstyles for easier reference
- draw website-wide assets (favicon, charpile logo, universe icons etc)
- artfight: archive the toyhouse wildcard page and submit a similar page that leads to this website instead
- after that just add more characters lma
